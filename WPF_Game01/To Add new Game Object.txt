1) Create new class in file "Nit.cs""

2) Pick the closest existing object and copy it into Nit.cs (Bullet.cs)

3) Rename all Bullet to Nit.

4) Go to G.cs and add the objects in the setupGameObjects function  

At this point the new objects shold behave like the one they were copied from.

5) Change the .png file, the constructor and update functions to match new object. (Also the launch function if there is one.)
